				world, and relays them to the corresponding game objects.
				The events in the GameObjects are triggered only after
				Box2D has finished its update phase, so it is safe to
				change b2Body's in the callback.
				This class also implements a contact filter interface to
				determine whether two fixtures are allowed to collide!
