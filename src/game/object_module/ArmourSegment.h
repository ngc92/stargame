		\brief A single segment of armour.
		\details This class models a single piece of outer space ship hull.
				It protects the ship, by the following damage model:

				Each ArmourSegment has an absorption value A. Incoming damage D is reduced
				by A, which is scaled by the armour status. D = D - A * HP/maxHP.

				The remaining damage is split into a transmitted part and a part that damages
				the armour itself.
