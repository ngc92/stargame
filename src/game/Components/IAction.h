		\brief Interface for actions that can be performed by components.
		\details This interface defines how components can communicate their
				intended actions towards the outside world. If a component
				wants to e.g. change the state of the spaceship, it needs
				to create the corresponding action.

				This class offers several act methods, that allow actions to
				affect different elements of the game environment. All these
				methods return a bool, which has to be true if the processing
				of this action is finished.

				Possible actions could be:
					Thrust for the engine/nozzles
					Spawn?/Shoot? for weapons
